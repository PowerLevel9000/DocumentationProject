      <p>
        Cyber Security is a process that's designed to protect networks and 
        devices from external threats. Businesses typically employ
        <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cyber-security-tutorial/how-to-become-cyber-security-engineer"
        class="info-link" target="_blank">
        Cyber Security professionals</a> 
        to protect their confidential information,
        maintain employee productivity, and enhance customer confidence 
        in products and services.
      </p>

      <p>
        The world of Cyber Security revolves around the industry standard of 
        confidentiality, integrity, and availability, or <a href="" class="info-link"
        target="_blank">CIA
        </a>. Privacy means data 
        can be accessed only by authorized parties; integrity means information 
        can be added, altered, or removed only by authorized users; and 
        availability means systems, functions, and data must be available 
        on-demand according to agreed-upon parameters.

    <article>
      
      <p>
        Cybercrime is any unauthorized activity involving a computer, 
        device, or network. The three types are computer-assisted crimes, 
        crimes where the computer itself is a target, and crimes where the 
        computer is incidental to the crime rather than directly related to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cybercriminals usually try to profit off of their crimes using a variety 
        of tactics, including:
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>
          Denial of Service, or DOS
        </li>
        <p class="description">
          Where a hacker consumes all of a server's 
          resources, so there's nothing for legitimate users to access
        </p>
        
        <li>Malware</li>
        <p class="description">
          Where victims are hit with a worm or virus that renders their 
          devices useless
        </p>

        <li>Man in the Middle</li>
        <p class="description">
          Where a hacker puts himself between a victim's machine and a router 
          to sniff data packets
        </p>

        <li>Phishing </li>
        <p class="description">
          Where a hacker sends a seemingly legitimate-looking email asking 
          users to disclose personal information
        </p>

      </ul>

      <p>Other types of cyberattacks include cross-site scripting attacks, 
        password attacks, eavesdropping attacks (which can also be physical), 
        SQL-injection attacks, and birthday attacks based on algorithm functions.

  <!--What Motivates Cyber Criminals?-->

  <section class="main-section" id="What_Motivates_Cyber_Criminals?">
    <header>What Motivates Cyber Criminals?</header>
    <article>

      <p>
        The main motive behind the cybercrime is to disrupt regular business activity 
        and critical infrastructure. Cybercriminals also commonly manipulate stolen data 
        to benefit financially, cause financial loss, damage a reputation, achieve 
        military objectives, and propagate religious or political beliefs. Some don't 
        even need a motive and might hack for fun or simply to showcase their skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        So who are these cybercriminals? Here's a breakdown of the most common types:
      </p>
      
      <ul>

        <li>Black-Hat Hackers </li>
        <p class="description">
          Black-hat hackers use fake identities to conduct malicious activities for a 
          profit
        </p>

        <li>Gray-Hat Hackers</li>
        <p class="description">
          They work both with malicious intent and as legitimate security analysts
        </p>

        <li>White-Hat Hackers</li>
        <p class="description">
          <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/white-hat-hacker-article" class="link-info" 
          target="_blank">White-hat hackers</a> work as security analysts to 
          detect and fix flaws and protect against malicious hackers
        </p>

        <li>Suicide Hackers</li>
        <p class="description">
          They aim to openly bring down the critical infrastructure for a social cause
        </p>

        <li>Script Kiddies</li>
        <p class="description">
          They are unskilled hackers who run scripts and software created by more 
          experienced hackers
        </p>

        <li>Cyber Terrorists</li>
        <p class="description">
          They create fear by disrupting large-scale computer networks; motivated by 
          religious or political beliefs
        </p>

        <li>State-Sponsored Hackers</li>
        <p class="description">
          They penetrate government networks, gain top-secret information, and damage 
          information systems; paid by a hostile government
        </p>

        <li>Hacktivists </li>
        <p class="description">
          Promote political agendas by secretly defacing and disabling websites 
        </p>

  <!--Who Are Cyber Security Experts?-->

  
  <section class="main-section continuelist" id="Who_Are_Cyber_Security_Experts?">
    <header>Who Are Cyber Security Experts?</header>

    <article>
      <p>
        As data breaches, hacking, and cybercrime reach new heights, companies are 
        increasingly relying on Cyber Security specialists to identify potential threats 
        and protect valuable data. It makes sense, then, that the Cyber Security market 
        is expected to grow from $152 billion in 2018 to $248 billion by 2023.
      </p>

      <p>
        So what do Cyber Security experts actually do? On any given day, they:
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>Find, test, and repair weaknesses within a company's infrastructure</li>
        <li>Monitor systems for malicious content</li>
        <li>Identify network breaches</li>
        <li>Install regular software updates, firewalls, and antivirus protection</li>
        <li>Strengthen areas where attacks may have occurred</li>

      </ul>

      <p>
        They work in one or more of these common Cyber Security domains to keep data safe:
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>Asset security: Analyze networks, computers, routers, and wireless access points</li>
        <li>Security architecture and engineering: Standardize security policies and procedures</li>
        <li>Communication and network security: Regulate cloud storage and data transfer</li>
        <li>Identity and access management: Track user authentication and accountability</li>
        <li>Security operations: Monitor security to identify attacks</li>
        <li>Security assessment and testing: Test security policies to ensure compliance with
           industry standards
        </li>
        <li>Software development security: Create and repeatedly test code</li>
        <li>Security and risk management: Identify potential risks and implement 
          appropriate security controls
        </li>

      </ul>

      <p>
        Cyber Security experts employ different tactics to secure computer systems and 
        networks. Some of the best practices include:
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>Using two-way authentication</li>
        <li>Securing passwords</li>
        <li>Installing regular updates</li>
        <li>Running antivirus software</li>
        <li>Using firewalls to disable unwanted services</li>
        <li>Avoiding phishing scams</li>
        <li>Employing cryptography, or encryption</li>
        <li>Securing domain name servers, or DNS</li>

      </ul>

    <header>What are the five types of cyber security?</header>

    <ol>

      <li>Critical infrastructure cyber security</li>
      <p class="description">Critical infrastructure organisations are often more vulnerable 
        to attack than others because SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) 
        systems often rely on older software.
      </p>

      <p class="description">Operators of essential services in the UK's energy, transport, 
        health, water and digital infrastructure sectors, and digital service providers are 
        bound by the <a href="" class="link-info">NIS Regulations.</a>
      </p>

      <p class="description">
        The Regulations require organisations to implement appropriate technical and 
        organisational measures to manage their security risks.
      </p>

      <li>Network security</li>
      <p class="description">
        Network security involves addressing vulnerabilities affecting your operating 
        systems and network architecture, including servers and hosts, firewalls and 
        wireless access points, and network protocols.
      </p>
      
      <li>Cloud security</li>
      <p class="description">
        Cloud security is concerned with securing data, applications, and infrastructure 
        in the Cloud.
      </p>
      
      <li>IoT (Internet of Things) security</li>
      <p class="description">
        IoT security involves securing smart devices and networks connected to the IoT. 
        IoT devices include things that connect to the Internet without human intervention, 
        such as smart fire alarms, lights, thermostats, and other appliances.
      </p>
      
      <li>Application security</li>
      <p class="description">
        Application security involves addressing vulnerabilities resulting from insecure 
        development processes in designing, coding, and publishing software or a website.

          <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/staff-awareness" class="link-info">
            Staff awareness</a> training will show employees how security 
            threats affect them and help them apply best-practice advice to real-world 
            situations.
        </p>

        <li>Application security</li>

        <li>Network security</li>
        <p class="description">
          Network security is the process of protecting the usability and integrity of your 
          network and data. This is achieved by conducting a 
          <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/external-network-penetration-testing" 
          class="link-info">network penetration test</a>, which assesses your network for vulnerabilities and security issues.

            cyber resilience
          </a>. Without it, it is tough to establish or enforce effective 
          processes. Top management must be prepared to invest in appropriate cyber security 
          resources, such as awareness training.
